  Some of the values in our posts don't have "IDs", like when we say
  icon-designer: Jim Nielsen

  So we have to turn those into IDs which we can reference via a parameter 
  in the URL. This allows us to pass values to the search page based on an ID
  Examples:

  Jim Nielsen       ->  jim-nielsen
  Bakken & Baeck    ->  bakken-%26-baeck
  Jakub AntalÃ­k     ->  jakub-antal%C3%ADk
