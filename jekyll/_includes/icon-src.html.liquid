  Because every icon should have the same path with the exception of the size,
  we'll use a single include to show it.
  include.size - the size of the icon you're trying to display

  Note: this is also used in feed files, so be aware of that if you change
  anything here.

  Includes:
  `post`
  `size`
{%- endcomment -%}
/img/{{ include.size }}/{{ include.post.slug }}-{{ include.post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}.png
